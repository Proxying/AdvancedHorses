-Horse stats. When hitting (right clicking) a horse with a lead, I want stats to pop up in chat for speed, health, and jump.
-Horses requiring hay bales nearby to feed on, else they die. Able to turn it on and off!
-Upon death, there being a configureable chance to spawn a zombie/skeleton horse.
-Hydration! If unhydrated, they are slower. One block of water or a cauldron (filled) minimum nearby.
-Horse genders. Random mares or stallions! Maybe a configureable option of percentage of mares vs stallions? Or else stallions are a higher chance. Maybe tie the gender into the horse stats (left click with lead)?
-Genders WORK. Two stallions can't breed, same with two mares! (Optional)
-Gelding a stallion. (maybe use a shears on a horse? ouch but it works xD). If its a gelding, it can't breed. (Optional, only if genders work too)
-Horse training. New horse will buck, stallions will buck more. Maybe a training-level stat when left-click with lead as well?
